    "Last week, we learned **probability theory**. Basically, *if you can count* by building your random-variable sets and the predicates you want to apply on the datasets with python, you do not need to know the math behind probability theory (but knowing some of the math is helpful). We even did a quick intro to **Bayes' formula**, which allows you to invert the precondition and the postcondition on a conditional probability to make probabilities easier to evaluate. That is very useful for data science interviews that involve probability questions. But Bayes' formula will open up a new universe of statistics for us, which we'll get into next class. For this class, let's learn **classical statistics** based on *classical probability theory*.\n",

    ">**DEFINITION**: What is a **random variable**? Find the math definition [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable). I prefer *this* definition: it's an Excel column of data. The $x$s are the *names* of each row. The $y$s are the cell *values*. $x$ is called the random variable, and $y$ is called its **range** $f(x)$. $f$ is the function we're after, to figure out from the data. Often, all we can get to is its *approximation*. The function $f$ is revelatory of the *mechanism that produced the data*, called the **model**. That is **data science** in a nutshell.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common question then follows: Wait a minute, the data may not be **random**. Why do you use the word **random**?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, according to [Ramsey theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey_theory), ideal randomness is *impossible* especially for large structures. While disorder is more probable in general, complete disorder is *impossible*. Misunderstanding of this can lead to numerous [conspiracy theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory). Saying randomness is impossible is tantamount to saying that a Uniform distribution (which we'll examine further below) for the random variable is *not possible*. In other words, it's not like throwing the dice, or flipping a coin. There must be *some order* in the data if it's produced by a natural phenomenon, and a histogram can help detect this order. For example, did you know that the number of emails you receive a day is ***not random***, meaning that if you count the humber of emails, all possible numbers are not equally probably? It's not like throwing the dice!\n",
    "\n",
    "The corollary of this of course is that if data is not random, you can model it and predict it!\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine models like regression forests are *sexy* because the computer builds the model (the function approximation) for you, but there are many cases where ***you can build the model for you*** (i.e. find the $f$), and before powerful computers, statisticians did not know about ML so they found the $f$ using math. So let's go back in time a couple of decades at least and look at what Neanderthal data scientists did. Actually, there is good stuff to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of statistical data analysis is to create a **model** for the data so you can throw away the data and use the model instead. After all, we already know *that is what intelligence is all about*. The more (low-dimensional) models you have, the less storage you need, the more models you can accomodate, the cleverer you are!\n",
    "\n",
    "A model's goal is usually to relate the influence of one variable on another. For example, how different medical interventions influence the incidence or duration of disease, how baseball players' performance varies as a function of age, how infectious diseases like the Coronavirus influence the stock market. The independent variable(s) $x$ is(are) called the predictor variable(s). The variable(s) $y$ to predict is(are) called the dependent variable(s), or target(s). We build the function approximation that gives us $y$ from $x$. *That* ***is*** data science.\n",
    "\n",
    ">**WHY** am I repeating myself? Because this is **so** important!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bayesian models**, which we're going to look at soon, involve advanced probabilistic programming. We only *now* have the computer power to run these programs. What did Neanderthal man do when he tried to do statistical data analysis?\n",

    "- A [Bernoulli Distribution]() has only two possible outcomes and a single trial.Â A simple example can be a single toss of a biased/unbiased coin. In this example, the probability that the outcome might be heads can be considered equal to p and (1 - p) for tails (the probabilities of mutually exclusive events that encompass all possible outcomes needs to sum up to one).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- A [binomial Distribution]() can be thought as the sum of outcomes of an event following a Bernoulli distribution. The Binomial Distribution is therefore used in binary outcome events and the probability of success and failure is the same in all the successive trials. This distribution takes two parameters as inputs: the number of times on event takes place and the probability assigned to one of the two classes. The binomial distribution is frequently used to model the number of successes in a sample of size n drawn with replacement from a population of size N. If the sampling is carried out without replacement, the draws are not independent and so the resulting distribution is a hypergeometric distribution, not a binomial one. However, for N much larger than n, the binomial distribution remains a good approximatio. A simple example of a Binomial Distribution in action can be the toss of a biased/unbiased coin repeated a certain amount of times, or picking balls from an urn (with replacement) that contains balls of two different colors. The main characteristics of a Binomial Distribution are:\n",
    " - Given multiple trials, each of them is independent of each other (the outcome  of one trial doesn't affect another one).\n",
    " - Each trial can lead to just two possible results (eg. winning or losing), which have probabilities p and (1 - p).\n",

    "skewness value is high in magnitude then the spread of our data will be different in\n",
    "one direction: It will be very *spread out* in one direction and in the other it will be\n",
    "*highly concentrated*. Poisson Processes are used to model a series of discrete events in which we know the average time between the occurrence of different events but we donâ€™t know exactly *when* each of these events might take place. For example, events that can be counted (e.g. emails or text messages). A process can be considered to belong to the class of Poisson Processes if it can meet the following criterias:\n",
    " - The events are independent of each other (if an event happens, this does not alter the probability that another event can take place).\n",
