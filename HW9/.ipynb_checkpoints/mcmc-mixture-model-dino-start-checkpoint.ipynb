    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we introduce Bayesian methodology by seeing how **posteriors** are affected by **priors** and **data likelhood**. We then a use Bayesian probabilistic programming library, `PyMC3`, to infer model parameters, which are probability distributions themselves according to Bayesian thinking. \n",
    "\n",
    "Their **means** give you the most probably values of the parameters, while their **standard deviations** tell you how much of a *mistake* you might be making in assuming each model parameter as the *mean* of its distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this information in hand, you can both use the model to generate simulated data *and also* have an idea of how much mistake you are making in the simulation. No need for p-values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian methodology is very similar to genetic algorithms. But instead of roulette wheel selection, crossover and mutation, Bayesian methods posit a **model**, then leverage Bayes' formula to refine probabilities of model parameters given new data (which ***warps*** model parameter state space), then navigate state space by visiting regions of higher posterior probability unitl convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's almost like solving a Rubik's cube. You build a model for how you think it should look, then you try to get closer and closer to the solution, sometimes probabilistically because you have no idea about the theory behind it..\n",

    "# 1. The Bayesian expectation fabric\n",
    "\n",
    "When we create a model with $N$ parameters that we want to solve with Baeysian inference, we are implicitly creating an $N$ dimensional space for the **prior** distribution of *each* paramater to live in. \n",
    "\n",
    "Associated with the space is an ***extra dimension***, which we can describe as the *surface*, or *manifold*, that sits on top of the space, that reflects the *probability* of observing data. The surface on the space is defined by our **prior** distribution and *warped* by the **data likelihood**. I call this fabric the **Bayesian expectation fabric**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we've worked in one dimension (one independent variable). Let's move to two dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have two unknown probability distributions $p_1$ and $p_2$, and priors for both are $\\text{Uniform}(0,5)$, the space created is a square of length 5 and the surface is a flat plane that sits on top of the square (representing the concept that *every point is equally likely*).

However, we cannot naively search the space: Traversing $N$-dimensional space is exponentially difficult in $N$: the size of the space quickly blows-up as we increase $N$ ([the curse of dimensionality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality)).\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we find these hidden mountains? The idea behind Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms is to perform an ***intelligent search*** of the space.\n",
    "\n",
    "MCMC algorithms like **Metropolis** return **samples** from the posterior distribution, not the distribution itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "MCMC performs a task similar to repeatedly asking \"*How likely is this pebble I found to be from the mountain I am searching for*?\", and completes its task by returning thousands of accepted pebbles in hopes of reconstructing the original mountain. In MCMC and PyMC3 lingo, the returned sequence of \"*pebbles*\" are the **samples**, cumulatively called the **traces**. \n",
    "\n",
    "MCMC does this by exploring nearby positions and moving into areas with higher probability, picking up samples from that area.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why do we pick up thousands of samples?\n",

    "Besides computational reasons, the strongest reason for returning samples is that we can easily use **the Law of Large Numbers** to solve otherwise intractable problems: With the thousands of samples, we can reconstruct the posterior surface by organizing them in a histogram, much like you were easily able to generate fake data when I gave you a histogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### MCMC algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a large family of algorithms that perform MCMC, not just Metropolis. Most of these algorithms can be expressed at a high level as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start at current position.\n",
    "2. Propose moving to a new position (investigate a pebble near you).\n",
    "3. Accept/Reject the new position based on the position's adherence to the data and prior distributions (ask if the pebble likely came from the mountain).\n",
    "4.  1.  If you accept: Move to the new position. Return to Step 1.\n",
    "    2. Else: Do not move to new position. Return to Step 1. \n",
    "5. After a large number of iterations, return all accepted positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way we move in the general direction towards regions where the posterior distributions live, and collect samples sparingly on the journey. Once we reach the posterior distribution, we can easily collect samples as they likely all belong to the posterior distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the current position of the MCMC algorithm is in an area of extremely low probability, which is often the case when the algorithm begins (typically at a random location in the space), the algorithm will move in positions *that are likely not from the posterior* but better than everything else nearby. Thus the first moves of the algorithm are not reflective of the posterior. That is why we often *throw away* the first samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above algorithm, notice that only the current position matters (new positions are investigated only near the current position). This property as *memorylessness*, i.e. the algorithm does not care *how* it arrived at its current position, only that it is there. That is why the chain is **Markovian**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other approximation solutions to the posterior\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides MCMC, there are other procedures available for determining the posterior distributions. [Gaussian Processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model) (GPs) are infinite-dimensional generalization of multivariate normal distributions. A machine-learning algorithm that involves a Gaussian process uses lazy learning and a measure of the similarity between points (the kernel function) to predict the value for an unseen point from training data. The prediction is not just an estimate for that point, but also has uncertainty information. Another method is [Variational Bayes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_Bayesian_methods). All three methods, GPs, Variational Bayes, and classical MCMC have their pros and cons."

Thus the two standard deviations are *dependent* on each other: if one is small, the other must be large. In fact, *all* the unknowns are related in a similar manner.

In fact, this is what it means to say the MCMC converged (in practice though we can never achieve total convergence). Hence if we observe different posterior analysis, it is likely because our MCMC has not *fully converged yet*, and we should not use samples from it yet (we should use a larger burn-in period).\n",

Ideally, we would like to have the chain start at the *peak* of our landscape, as this is exactly where the posterior distributions exist. Hence, if we started at the peak, we could avoid a lengthy burn-in period and incorrect inference. Generally, we call this *peak* the [maximum a posterior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_a_posteriori_estimation) or, more simply, the *MAP*.\n",

A confidence level represents the frequency (i.e. the proportion) of possible confidence intervals that contain the true value of the unknown population parameter. In other words, if confidence intervals are constructed using a given confidence level from an infinite number of independent sample statistics (parallel universes), the proportion of those intervals that contain the true value of the parameter will be equal to the confidence level.For example, if the confidence level (CL) is 95% then in hypothetical indefinite data collection, in 95% of the samples the interval estimate will contain the true population parameter. This is not the same as saying \"*there is a 95% chance the parameter of interest lies in this interval*\", and I much prefer the latter over the former!"

    "## Useful tips for MCMC\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian inference would be the *de facto* method if it weren't for MCMC's computational difficulties (especially of the denominator). In fact, MCMC is what turns most users off practical Bayesian inference. Below are some good heuristics  to help convergence and speed up the MCMC engine. This is all part of the *art* of Bayesian estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intelligent starting values\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be great to start the MCMC algorithm off near the posterior distribution, so that it will take little time to start sampling correctly. We can aid the algorithm by telling where we *think* the posterior distribution will be by specifying the `testval` parameter in the `Stochastic` variable creation. In many cases we can produce a reasonable guess for the parameter. For example, if we have data from a Normal distribution, and we wish to estimate the $\\mu$ parameter, then a good starting value would be the *mean* of the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "     mu = pm.Uniform( \"mu\", 0, 100, testval = data.mean() )\n",
    "\n",
    "For most parameters in models, there is a frequentist estimate of it. These estimates are a good starting value for our MCMC algorithms. Of course, this is not always possible for some variables, but including as many appropriate initial values is always a good idea. Even if your guesses are wrong, the MCMC will still converge to the proper distribution, so there is little to lose.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what using `MAP` tries to do, by giving good initial values to the MCMC. So why bother specifying user-defined values? Well, even giving `MAP` good values will help it find the maximum a-posterior. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also important, *bad initial values* are a source of major bugs in PyMC3 and can hurt convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Good Priors\n",
    "\n",
    "If the priors are poorly chosen, the MCMC algorithm may not converge, or at least have difficulty converging. Consider what may happen if the prior chosen does not even contain the true parameter: the prior assigns 0 probability to the unknown, hence the posterior will assign 0 probability as well. This can cause pathological results.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, it is best to *carefully* choose the priors. Often, lack of covergence or evidence of samples crowding to boundaries implies something is wrong with the chosen priors (see *Folk Theorem of Statistical Computing* below). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Covariance matrices and eliminating parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimizing the number of parameters in your model and especially parameters that are interdependent is an important consideration. You can use covariance matrices to see if parameters turn out to be very dependent. If so, return to the drawing board and build a lower-dimensional model with statistically independent parameters.\n",
