    "\n",
    "So far, we have made the assumption that every outcome in a sample space (urn) is ***equally likely***: Same probability to select White ball \\#1 as Red ball \\#5. \n",
    "\n",
    ">**Recall**: A probability is a **fraction** where the numerator is sum of all *favorable* outcomes, and the denominator the sum of all *possible* outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In real life, we often get outcomes that are not **equiprobable**. Foe example, White ball versus Red ball. For another example, the probability of a child being a girl is not exactly 1/2, and the probability is slightly different for a second child. \n",
    "\n",
    "An [article](http://people.kzoo.edu/barth/math105/moreboys.pdf) (good Data Science article, you should read it) gives the following *counts* for two-child families in Denmark, where `GB` means a family where the first child is a girl and the second a boy:\n",
    "\n",
    "    GG: 121801    GB: 126840\n",
    "    BG: 127123    BB: 135138\n",
    "    \n",
    "Because of this fact (not all urns yield Blue/Red/White *numbered* balls with equiprobable chances), we need to introduce three more definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_%28statistics%29): a number describing how often an outcome occurs. Can be a count like 121801, or a ratio like 0.515.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Distribution](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/StatisticalDistribution.html): A mapping from outcome to frequency for each possible outcome in a sample space. \n",
    "\n",
    "* [Probability Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution): The distribution above, which has been *normalized* so that the sum of the frequencies is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a ***super-popular*** probability distribution:\n",
    "* The binomial distribution is frequently used to model the number of successes in a sample of size n drawn with replacement from a population of size N. It is parametrized by p and is the discrete probability distribution of the number of `yes`es in a sequence of n independent experiments *with replacement*, each asking a `yes/no` question, and each with its own boolean-valued outcome: a random variable containing a single bit of information: `yes` (with probability p) or `no` (with probability q = 1 âˆ’ p)\n",
    "\n",
    "* A single `yes/no` experiment is also called a *Bernoulli trial* or *Bernoulli experiment* and a sequence of outcomes is called a *Bernoulli process*\n",
    "\n",
    "* For a single trial, i.e., n = 1, the binomial distribution is a Bernoulli distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "So now we need to modify our awesome probability counting `p()` function (which takes each event as **equiprobable**) to take this miserable fact into account. Essentially, it's as if each *numbered ball* comes with its *own* probability of being picked. So we will need to use probability **dictionaries**.\n",

One is yellow and one is green.  What is the probability that the yellow M&M came from the 1994 bag? Well, the old M&M bags' yellow count was higher, so it must be higher, right?

For example, when we consider an experiment in which we roll *two* dice and observe their sum, we could model the situation with *two* random variables, one for each die (our representation of outcomes has been doing that implicitly all along, when we concatenate two parts of a string, but the concept of a random variable makes it official.)\n",

    "We are just before the Singaporean Grand Prix (this coming weekend) and the Russian Grand Prix the weekend after, as you can see [schedule](https://www.formula1.com/en/racing/2019.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "The 2019 driver standings are given [here](https://www.formula1.com/en/results.html/2019/drivers.html). Assume these standings for this weekend, even though they are final season standings. Given these standings (please do not use team standings given on the same Web site, use ***driver standings***), what is the Probability Distribution for each F1 driver to win the Singaporean Grand Prix? What is the Probability Distribution for each F1 driver to win *both* the Singaporean and Russian Grand Prix? What is the probability for Mercedes to win both races? What is the probability for Mercedes to win at least one race? Note that Mercedes, and each other racing team, has two drivers per race. Assume that Singaporean grand prix standings are not going to change driver standings by much, so you can use same standings for both races.\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 1.2 (30 points) If Mercedes wins the first race, what is the probability that Mercedes wins the next one? If Mercedes wins at least one of these two races, what is the probability Mercedes wins both races? How about Ferrari, Red Bull, and Renault?\n",
    "\n",
    "Question 1.3 (50 points) Mercedes wins at least one of these two races on a **rainy** day. What is the probability Mercedes wins both races, assuming races can be held on either rainy, sunny, cloudy, snowy or foggy days? Assume that rain, sun, clouds, snow, and fog are the *only possible weather conditions* on race tracks.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to provide *proof* for your answers. `I think it's one in a million because Mercedes sucks and I like Ferrari a lot more` is not a good answer. Leverage the counting framework in this workbook!"
