    ">   Another way of thinking about this: unlike a traditional program, which only runs in the forward directions, a probabilistic program is run in both the forward and backward direction. It runs forward to compute consequences of assumptions it contains about the model, but also backward from the data to constrain possible explanations. In practice, many probabilistic programming systems will cleverly interleave forward and backward operations to efficiently home in on the best explanations.  - [Cronin, Beau. \"Why Probabilistic Programming Matters.\" 24 Mar 2013.

    "> ### Bayesian Software\n",
    "> There is a good amount of software options for Bayesians, including both open source software (*e.g.*, [Stan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_(software)), PyMC3, JAGS, emcee) and commercial (*e.g.*, SAS, Stata). Your instructor happens to love `PyMC3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyMC3 is a Python library for programming Bayesian analysis; see [here](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.55). It's a  wonderful package. Looky [here](https://docs.pymc.io/) for its API and docs. It helps us solve tough inverse problems and extract a model from the data. We will use its `Metropolis()` and `NUTS()` APIs most often, and we'll even tinker with the Metropolis algorithm next week.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will model our radon dataset using PyMC3.  \n",
    "\n",
    "PyMC3 used to rely on [**theano**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theano_(software), a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently, and which we will revisit when we focus on machine learning. Theano is the brainchild of [Yoshua Benjio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshua_Bengio) of the University of Montreal's [MILA](https://mila.quebec/en/) laboratory. In my opinion, it's the most famous university lab associated to artificial neural networks and deep learning. It's pretty [well-funded](http://nouvelles.umontreal.ca/en/article/2017/09/15/facebook-invests-over-7m-u.s.-in-mila-and-ai-research-in-montreal/).\n",
    "\n",
    "`theano` is slowly being deprecated because other libraries like facebook's `Torch` and Google's `TensorFlow` now include the same features. Old PyMC3 versions still uses theano, but the newer versions don't, they use [**tensorflow**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TensorFlow) instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "`theano` is notorious in that it is often difficult to install, especially on the Mac. One option is to run the notebook on the Cloud, or to use `Sampyl` instead of `PyMC3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For probabilistic programming, you write a program in Python that builds expressions for Theano. You still have to declare variables $a,b,c$ and give their types $(int, int, int)$, build expressions for how to put those variables together, like $a^b + c$, and compile expression graphs to functions $Pow(a,b,c)$ in order to use them for computation. What theano builds in return is a super-fast callable object from a purely symbolic graph, optimizes the graph, and even compiles some or all of it into native machine instructions. More on Theano [here](http://www.deeplearning.net/software/theano/). \n",

Now in these windows, type `conda install -c mila-udem theano pygpu`. Wait until success. Then in that same terminal, type `conda install pymc3`. Wait until success.\n",

You might think that it's picking the right statistical profile that matches the histogram of the dataset, but that's usually not that hard. Picking the shape of the pdf for each model parameter is harder because you don't have a physical profile to match! And then, you also need to pick initial conditions for these parameters. \n",

If you ***make the right choices*** (and that is often the *art* behind Bayesian inference), then Bayesian packages like `PyMc3` will do all the work for you, and you will get a good **model** of your dataset, and then you can throw away all the historical data and use that model to do predictions. If you make the *wrong choice*, most often your computation won't converge or you will get very strange results. In which case, go watch an episode of GoT, then start from scratch."
